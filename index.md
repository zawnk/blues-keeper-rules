### Entry Level Draft Order

The draft will be held in snake-order.

#### Initial Order

For the very first draft, the draft order will be randomized.

#### Subsequent Order

Any subsequent draft after the initial season, the draft order will be determined as follows:

Picks 1-6 (lottery streamed and done via [draftpicklottery.com](https://www.draftpicklottery.com/lottery.php)):

- 25% Winner of the Consolation Bracket
- 21% Runner-Up of the Consolation Bracket
- 18% 3rd Place of the Consolation Bracket
- 15% 4th Place of the Consolation Bracket
- 12% 5th Place of the Consolation Bracket
- 9% 6th Place of the Consolation Bracket

Picks 7-12 (in order):

- Second last place of Champion Bracket (5th)
- Last place of Champion Bracket (6th)
- 3rd Place of the Champion Bracket
- 4th Place of the Champion Bracket
- Runner-Up of the Champion Bracket (2nd)
- Champion of the Champion Bracket (1st)

### Player Contract System

At the end of each season, players can hand out contracts to their players, effectively **protecting them from being draftable in the upcoming Entry Level Draft**. The player can hand out contracts with the length of four, three, two or one years. One week before the draft takes place, the commissioners make sure that each team is "Contract Compliant".  
A team can have a maximum amount of:

- One 4-year-contract
- Two 3-year-contracts
- Three 2-year-contracts
- Four 1-year-contracts

If the team is under the limit for a specific contract length, they can put any player without a contract on their team under contract, as long as they obide the limits. Players that have an active contract, can not be contracted again or extended. Teams are free to use less contracts than the limit. If they have more contracts than allowed, they have to dissolve (a) contract(s) of their choice.  
After the draft has taken place and a new season starts, one level is subtracted from their contracts. Then, at the end of the season, teams have to make sure that they're Contract Compliant again and the process repeats.  
If the team has players that lose their contracts next season (i.e. before the draft takes place they have one year left), those players can not receive new contracts at the end of the season and will therefore be available at the upcoming draft to any team. This counts on a player and not team basis, that means even trading those players does not make them eligible to receive contracts before the draft happens. Players that have only one year left on their contract before the draft will be tracked in a public spreadsheet by the league commissioners.

#### Entry Level Contracts

Teams get additional contracts for so-called Entry Level players. If the team employs a player that is under the age of 24, they have the option - before using any regular contract to draft-protect this player - to give them a **one year Entry Level Contract (ELC)**. ELCs are completely seperate from the regular contracts and play no role in being Contract Compliant. A team can hand out **a maximum of three ELC** in a single season before the draft. A player can only receive a single ELC.  
If the team wishes to keep the player after his ELC year, they have assign a regular contract to the player. Players with ELCs are tracked in a public spreadsheet by the league commissioners.

Using an ELC to protect a player, will take away a draft pick of the team per ELC **from the back of their draft rounds**.

### Minors

In addition to the slots mentioned in [Roster Slots](#Rooster-Slots), the player has three additional bench slots for minor players. Minor players can't contribute to the team's score as long as they're on a minor bench slot. Players lose their minor status, once they:

- Leave the minor leagues (in real-life)
- They reach the age of XXX
- They player has reached X career games

Minor players do not need to be protected before the draft, as they are automatically protected.

## Trading

### Waivers

Players dropped off a team are placed on waivers for 3 (?) days. Players with contracts keep their contracts, even after being dropped off a team. If they're not picked up during their waiver period, they become free agents, lose their current contract and can be picked up by any team. Once picked up, players become available to score for their new team the next day (cut-off is midnight PT).

### Team to Team

Players that are part of a trade between two teams **keep their contract** status. This means: if there are any years left on the contracts, they will also have these years left on the new team. If they ran out of their contract at the beginning of the season, they're ineligible to receive a new contact at the end of the season and will be available in the draft.

### Draft Picks

Draft picks can be part of a trade, even though some limits apply. [The roster size](#Roster-Slots) is 24 players and teams can have 10 contracts, which means that each subsequent drafts after the initial one will have 14 rounds. Teams can also potentially protect young players with [ELCs](#Entry-Level-Contracts) up to a maximum of three. Therefore, only 11 picks are guaranteed for a team and therefore only picks 1 to 11 can be traded.

## Organization

### Platform

- League will be played on Fantrax
- Premium is needed (? if so, add paragraph about how we go about paying w/ deadlines)

### Rule Changes

- Mid-season rule changes can be brought up by any team but require unanimous agreement and will be applied retroactively if possible
- Off-season rule changes require unanimous commissioner agreement and need to be made public to all teams before payment is due (if needed)
- All changes made to the rules need to be written down in detail with responsible and date in the [Changelog section](#Changelog)

### Communication

- Team managers need to be available and pingable in the [St. Louis Blues Discord](https://discord.gg/5YQfyNY). This is where any communication takes place (e.g. rule changes, deadline information, reminders, etc.)

## Penalties

### Not being Contract Compliant by deadline

Action 1: Reminder send to team owner and new deadline is two days later

Action 2: If still not compliant, commissioners will randomly cancel contracts of each length until the player is Contract Compliant


## Commissioner Tasks

- Organize rule change votes
- Keep a public list of players that are protected via ELCs by their team
- Make sure players ineligible to receive ELCs do not receive new ELCs
- Keep a public list of players that have only a single year left on their contract before the draft and are therefore not eligible to receive another contract before being drafted again
- Make sure that players ineligible for contracts do not receive new contracts
- Set contract years of players chosen by the teams before the draft in Fantrax
- Enforce [Penalties](#Penalties)
